# ðŸ“Š Sales Prediction using Advertising Data

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting product sales based on advertising budgets across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. By applying Linear Regression using Python, we aim to help businesses optimize their marketing strategies and maximize their sales potential.
